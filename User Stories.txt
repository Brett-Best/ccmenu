High-priority Stories
=====================

#26 Exclude projects from aggregation to status bar item: As a developer I want to exclude projects that are visible in the menu from the aggregation to the status bar item so that the status bar item provides information about the project I care about most but I can still keep an eye on other projects in the menu.          

#33 Turn off notifications by project: As a developer I want to select on a per-project basis whether notifications about status transitions are reported so that I get information about the projects I care about most but I can still keep an eye on other projects in the menu. [See #26]

#27 Display project status heatmap in status item: As a developer I want to see the status of multiple projects in the status bar item so that I can have a detailed view without opening the menu or window. This would be a 2-pixel vertical line per project, maybe with a dot running top to bottom when the project is building.

#25 Publish notification if current build time exceeds last build time by x: As a developer I want CCMenu to notify me (via Growl) if the current build time exceeds the last build time by a margin that I can configure so that I am alerted as soon as possible about a build that might be stuck.


Low-priority Stories
====================

#21 Force build: As a developer I want to e able to force a build from the project window so that I do not have to go to the dashboard for this operation. [Few servers support this.] 

#22 Selectable columns: As a developer I want to configure which columns are visible in the project window so that I can see the information that is most relevant to me. [Project window not used much?]

#23 Absolute build time format: As a developer I want to set the format in which the last build times are displayed so that I can see relevant information in the format that suits me best.


Internal Bugs
=============

- build status change notifications sent during event handling
- many strings not localizable
