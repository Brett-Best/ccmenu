CCMenu
======

**CCMenu displays the build status of projects on a continuous integration server as an item in the Mac's menu bar. It started as part of the CruiseControl project that built the first continuous integration server.**

For documentation and support please visit [ccmenu.org][].

To download and install CCMenu please visit the [Mac App Store][].

It is possible that the release notes list a version as released, that a corresponding tag exists in the source code and, still, that version is not available on the App Store. This happens because it can take 1-2 weeks for the release to make it through Apple's review process.

If you are an implementor of a CI server or you need help with setting up CCMenu for a specific server, please see the [wiki][].
